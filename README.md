One Paragraph Summary:
  The PoetLibrary enables you to utilize the CMU Dictionary
  <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict> to create
  and examine poetry by enabling you to examine 
  a text's meter - the stressed and unstressed syllables 
  - and determine the text's meter's adherance to 
  a defined poem form (iambic pentameter, 
  anapestic tetrameter, et cetera).

  This build contains the ability to conduct meter analysis 
of a poem.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview
  The purpose of this library is to be an aid in studying or
writing poetry.  Since the fundamental, and more technical
and definable, aspects of poetry are rhyme and meter, this
library is specifically made to analyze a poem's adherance
to a specific, user defined, meter and rhyme scheme.

------------------------------------------------------------
2.  How to use this library
  Included in this project is a file called "test.py" which 
provides the fundamentals for implementing this library.
  When using the library, you should include only the 
poetlibrary module.
  There are a few examples in this library on how to use it,
and the names of these example files begin with "test."

------------------------------------------------------------
3.  List of the included files
  The files that are included in this build are:
cmudict.0.7a.txt
forms.py
mdict.py
opendictionary.py
parseDictionary.py
poemclass.py

It should be noted that pickled_dictionary
will be created when the library runs for the first time
and can be built at any time through the parseDictionary
module.
